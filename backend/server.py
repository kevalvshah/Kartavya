"""
server.py — Kartavaya API v2 by Aekam Inc
Monolith routes stay; new v2 routers mounted at the bottom.
R2 upload router replaces the old base64 /api/upload endpoint.

Bug fixes (2026-05-14):
  FIX #4: get_visible_team_ids UNIONed team_members so users who were invited
          and registered after the invite (no project_assignments row) could
          still see their teams. SUPERSEDED 2026-08-22 — migration 195 copied
          every one of those rows into project_assignments (the gap was 127),
          so the UNION now has nothing left to add and the reads below ask one
          table. See "PHASE 2" on get_visible_team_ids for what still writes
          both, and why it must keep doing so.
  FIX #5: update_team_member guards the project_assignments role UPDATE
          with `if payload.role` to avoid writing NULL when only status
          is being changed.

# every user for ten days and was found by accident.
#
# The defaults are the danger. Measured against the pinned SDK:
#   · include_local_variables defaults TRUE — every frame's locals are
#     serialized, so a 500 in payroll or CRM ships salary figures, PAN and
#     rendered email bodies. A regex cannot save this: a short plaintext
#     password inside a model repr has no pattern. It must be OFF, not filtered.
#   · request BODIES are attached regardless of send_default_pii — only cookies
#     and identity are PII-gated — bounded only by a 10 KB default.
#   · LoggingIntegration is a DEFAULT integration, so every logger.error becomes
#     an event; four of this backend's error lines interpolate a recipient's
#     email address.
#   · SQL breadcrumbs are added unconditionally, from a database production
#     shares.

# ── Interactive API docs: on everywhere except production ────────────────────
#
# /docs and /openapi.json were reachable on production WITH NO CREDENTIAL,
# serving 116 endpoint paths and 54 data schemas — including the whole
# /api/admin/* surface, request and response shapes, and every field name.
#
# That is not itself a vulnerability: the endpoints behind it still require auth.
# It is reconnaissance. It hands anyone the complete map of what to attack, which
# fields exist on a payslip, and which admin routes to try first — for a product
# holding payroll and bank details.
#
# Staging KEEPS them: they are how the API gets exercised by hand, and staging is
# the environment that exists to be poked at. The switch is an explicit env var
# rather than a code change, so it can be turned on for an hour to debug
# production and back off again without a deploy.
# os.environ.get(k, default) returns "" for a var that is SET BUT EMPTY, not the
# default — and an empty ENVIRONMENT is easy to end up with in a Railway config.
# Read naively, "" != "production" and the docs come back on in production. This
# has to fail CLOSED, so empty is treated as unset.
#
# The empty case was fixed. The SPELLING case was not, and it reopened the same
# hole: `_ENVIRONMENT != "production"` is a denylist with exactly one entry, so
# every value that is not that precise 10-character lowercase string turned the
# docs back on. Measured, before this change:
#
#     ENVIRONMENT=production   docs off
#     ENVIRONMENT=Production   DOCS ON      <- Railway environment names are
#     ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION   DOCS ON         free text and are title-cased by
#     ENVIRONMENT=prod         DOCS ON         hand all the time
#     ENVIRONMENT=main         DOCS ON
#     ENVIRONMENT=live         DOCS ON
#
# `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` carries whatever the environment was NAMED in the
# dashboard, so "Production" is not a hypothetical typo — it is what you get by
# creating the environment through the UI and capitalising it.
#
# So the test is inverted into an ALLOWLIST. Docs are served only when the
# environment is a name we recognise as non-production. Anything unrecognised —
# a new environment name, a typo, a capitalisation, an empty value, a variable
# that never got set — is treated as production and serves nothing. Adding a new
# non-production environment now requires adding it here, which is a visible
# change in a security-relevant list rather than a silent default.

#
# What that granted, precisely, because the honest severity is not the dramatic
# one: `allow_credentials=True` below, so a permitted origin may READ responses
# that carry credentials. It was NOT exploitable, for two reasons that both had
# to hold — the `session_token` cookie is `SameSite=Lax`, which browsers do not
# attach to a cross-site fetch, and `COOKIE_DOMAIN` is unset so the cookie is
# host-only on the API. Auth is otherwise a Bearer token in `localStorage`,
# which no other origin can read.
#
# It is removed anyway. Both of those mitigations are one config change away
# from gone — somebody hits a cross-site problem, sets `SameSite=None`, and a
# domain a stranger can buy is holding a credentialed grant on the production
# API. An allowlist entry for a host we do not own has no upside to weigh

    ── PHASE 2: THIS READS `project_assignments`, NOT `team_members` ───────────

    Project membership used to be answered by TWO tables that disagreed, and
    every leg below UNIONed them. `PROPOSED_080_team_members_retire.sql` records
    the six-step retirement; migration 195 was step 1 and is applied.

    Measured on the live database AFTER 195, on 2026-08-22:

        team_members (every row status='active')                   198
        project_assignments                                        219
        active team_members with NO project_assignments row           0
        project_assignments with no active team_members row          21
        rows where the two disagree about ROLE                        0

    `project_assignments` is a strict superset of `team_members` at identical
    roles. That — and only that — is what makes dropping the `team_members` leg
    safe: it cannot narrow anybody's answer, because there is no row it was
    contributing that the other table does not already carry. If somebody
    reverses migration 195, this function starts revoking access silently, so
    do not un-apply it without putting the leg back first.

    THE WRITES STILL GO TO BOTH TABLES. `create_team`, `_ensure_default_owner`,
    `add_team_member`, `update_team_member` and `remove_team_member` all
    maintain `team_members` alongside `project_assignments`, because step 4 of
    the retirement is a RENAME and a rename is only reversible while the renamed
    table is still current. Cutting the reads over and the writes over in one
    change throws the rollback away.

    ── `include_archived` DEFAULTS TO TRUE, AND THAT DIRECTION IS DELIBERATE ──

    Archiving a finished project (migration 104) hides it from pickers and
    boards and must NOT hide it from reports: revenue, hours, invoices and
    payroll for a completed engagement are exactly the numbers a firm looks
    back at. A year-end total that silently drops every finished project is
    worse than no total at all.

    So the default is the SAFE one. A caller that forgets this parameter keeps
    counting everything, which is wrong on a picker in a visible, complainable
    way — "why is last year's audit still in my list" — and wrong on a report in
    a way nobody notices until the figure is used. Given one of those has to be
    the default, it is the one that fails loudly.

    The cache key carries the flag, or the first caller in a request would
    decide the answer for every later one — and a report and a board genuinely
    do run in the same request.

    ── `org_id` IS THE ACTIVE ORGANISATION, AND IT IS ENFORCED ─────────────────

    Pass the value `Depends(get_org_id)` resolved: it has already been validated
    against the caller's `user_roles` rows, so this function does not re-litigate
    membership, it OBEYS the answer.

    This parameter did not exist, and that was the defect. The owner holds
    org_admin in three organisations; they picked E2E Test in the switcher and
    the Projects page rendered Aekam Inc's projects. Two mechanisms, one screen:

      * the admin branch asked `admin_org_id(user_id)` with no org, and got one
        of three rows chosen by planner luck — always Aekam Inc in practice;
      * the fall-through branch UNIONed `project_assignments`, `team_members`
        and `user_roles` constrained BY USER ONLY, so a member of two orgs got
        the union of both. Measured on the live database: Aekam Inc's 24 teams
        and 219 tasks came back on every page load in every org, while E2E Test
        actually holds 1 team and 332 tasks.

    Every branch below now carries `org_id` as a BIND PARAMETER rather than
    filtering in Python afterwards. That distinction is the whole guarantee: a
    predicate the database enforces cannot be skipped by a later `if`, and a
    branch added below without one fails `test_active_org_visibility.py`'s
    property test rather than quietly leaking.

    ── WHEN NO ORG IS PASSED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It resolves the caller's HOME org — `_home_org_id`, the same earliest-grant
    rule `get_org_id` uses with no header — and scopes to that. It does not fall
    back to the old union. A caller that cannot name an org (the notification
    sweep, the scheduler, a route not yet threaded) gets ONE org's answer, and
    the same one the request would have resolved anyway. Only a user who belongs
    to no organisation at all reaches the unscoped path, and for them there is no
    second org to leak from — they see the teams their own membership rows name,
    which is what a portal client is.

    ── THE CACHE KEY CARRIES THE ORG ───────────────────────────────────────────

    Or the first caller in a request decides the answer for every later one. That
    is not hypothetical here the way it is for `include_archived`: `get_org_id`
    is itself cached on `request.state`, so a request genuinely can ask this
    question for one org and then for another, and a key without the org would
    serve the first org's teams for the second WITH NO QUERY ISSUED AT ALL —
    the failure that leaves no trace in the logs.

    #
    # `is_org_admin(user_id)` answers True for a PLATFORM role as well as for
    # org_owner/org_admin, and with no org argument it answers globally.
    # `admin_org_id` then looks for an ORG-SCOPED admin row — and its own
    # docstring records what used to happen next: "Returns None for platform
    # staff with no org row, which the callers treat as unrestricted."
    #
    # This was that caller. `SELECT team_id FROM teams WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
    # has no predicate at all. Measured on the live database today: 7 of the 10
    # platform accounts hold a platform role and NO org-scoped admin row, so all
    # seven received every one of the 29 teams across all 3 organisations, and
    # through them 557 tasks. No header, no forged id, no special request —
    # this one fires on an ordinary page load.
    #
    # FAIL CLOSED, and note the fall-through is not "nothing": an admin with no
    # org row is simply a user, so they keep exactly the teams their own
    # memberships give them. For the vendor's own staff, who are members of
    # Aekam Inc, that is Aekam's teams — which is the whole of what the owner
    # says god mode should see. The only people who lose anything are accounts
    # belonging to no org, and what they lose is other companies' data.
    #
    # `search.py` and `tasks_bulk.py` already re-narrow this list to the active
    # org, so they were never exposed. They are two callers out of many, which
    # is precisely why the narrowing belongs here rather than at each call site.
    #
    # ── ADMIN OF *THIS* ORG, NOT ADMIN OF SOME ORG ──────────────────────────
    #
    # With an org in hand the question is asked ABOUT THAT ORG, and `org` is the
    # answer's scope whether or not the caller administers it. `admin_org_id` is
    # only consulted on the unscoped path now, because on the scoped path there
    # is nothing for it to decide: we already know which org, and all that
    # remains is whether this caller sees all of it or only their own memberships

        # Anchoring on `teams` and asking the membership questions as EXISTS
        # puts `t.org_id = $2` in front of every leg at once, so there is one
        # place the predicate can go missing instead of three.
        #
        # There were THREE legs here until 2026-08-22; the `team_members` one is

        #
        # `t.deleted_at IS NULL` now covers both legs. It previously
        # governed only the `user_roles` leg, so a soft-deleted project still
        # appeared for anyone holding a direct assignment row on it.
        #
        # THE `org_id IS NULL` LEG IS NOT A HOLE, and it is spelled out rather
        # than folded into the predicate above so it cannot be read as one.
        # 2 of the 29 live teams carry no `org_id`. A team in no organisation is
        # not "another organisation's data" — there is no tenant it could be
        # leaking from — and it was never reachable through the `user_roles` leg
        # anyway, since `ur.org_id = t.org_id` never matches NULL. It was

        # stays reachable by here. `routers/search.py` and `routers/tasks_bulk.py`
        # both already write `(org_id IS NULL OR org_id = $2)` in their own
        # narrowing for the same reason; had this branch dropped them, those two
        # clauses would have quietly become dead code and the members of those
        # two teams would have lost them from search, bulk edit and the task
        # list with nothing to point at.
        #
        # ── WHAT THIS BRANCH COSTS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED ────────────
        #
        # Before, a direct membership row was sufficient on its own whatever org
        # the team was in. Now it is not: a team in a DIFFERENT, non-null org is
        # unreachable, and the user cannot switch to that org to get it back —
        # `get_org_id` requires a `staging.user_roles` row on both its header
        # path and its fallback, so the header 403s, `active_org_id` turns that
        # into None and `_home_org_id` returns their OTHER org.
        #
        # Read-only against the live database on 2026-08-06, that population is
        # NOT empty: 3 users, 4 (user, team) pairs, 22 tasks, over 3 live teams
        # in 2 orgs. One of the three is the VENDOR's own platform_admin sitting
        # on two Unicode Group project teams — restoring that would be restoring
        # the cross-tenant read this whole change exists to close, so the answer
        # is not simply "seed everyone a row". The rows, the query that found
        # them and the per-user decision are written up in
        # `migrations/120_seed_missing_org_roles.sql`, which is deliberately NOT
        # applied: who belongs to which organisation is the owner's call.
        #
        # The narrowing SHIPS ANYWAY. This is a tenancy boundary, and a leak
        # outranks a regression in convenience; 22 tasks becoming unreachable to
        # 3 accounts is the price, it is named here so nobody has to rediscover

    ── WHAT THIS USED TO DO, AND WHY IT WAS THE WORST OF THE THREE ─────────────

    The first line was:

        if user.get("role") in ("admin", "owner"):
            return {"role": "admin"}

    That is not "trusting the legacy column" — it is a synthetic membership
    returned from the JWT claim with NO DATABASE QUERY AT ALL. Measured with a
    pool that raises on any query:

        is_project_member(pool, 'team_belonging_to_another_org',
                          {'user_id': 'user_x', 'role': 'admin'})
            -> {'role': 'admin'}          (nothing was asked)

    So the claim on the token granted PROJECT-ADMIN of every project in the
    database — any `team_id`, no org predicate, no team predicate — and it was
    `users.role` as it stood WHEN THE TOKEN WAS MINTED, which survives the flag
    being revoked and cannot be scoped to an organisation at all. `users.role`
    is a per-user GLOBAL column; the tier model is per-org and per-module.

    Ten routes are gated on this. Five of them test `mem["role"] in
    ("owner","admin")`, which the synthetic dict satisfied: create/update/delete
    and reorder columns, and the project brand kit.

    ── WHAT IT ASKS NOW ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The same question the rest of this file already asks — `is_org_admin`
    against `staging.user_roles`, at request time — and SCOPED TO THIS TEAM'S
    ORG, because `middleware/roles.is_org_admin`'s scoped branch requires the
    platform holder to actually belong to that org. `approvals_router.py:124`
    wrote down two hours before this change why it refused to reuse this helper.
    It can be reused now.

    `org_id IS NULL` falls through to the unscoped call deliberately: 2 of the
    29 live teams have no org, there is nothing to scope to, and
    `get_visible_team_ids` already relies on the same fall-through. Refusing
    there would break both.

    ── AND IT RETURNS THE REAL ROLE ────────────────────────────────────────────

    Membership is read BEFORE the admin question, and the row is returned as it
    stands rather than collapsed to `{"role": "admin"}`. That is what lets a
    caller tell a Tier-3 `client` from an owner — the distinction `create_task`
    could not previously make, because every answer said `admin`.

    ── WHAT THE NARROWING COSTS, MEASURED ──────────────────────────────────────

    Six accounts hold `users.role IN ('admin','owner')`, all six
    vendor-controlled. Five hold a real `staging.user_roles` org row and keep
    every project inside their own org. The sixth (sid@aekaminc.com) holds
    `platform_admin` and NO org row — and `get_visible_team_ids` already returns
    zero teams for exactly that shape, since 965d0e82. This change makes the two
    agree; it does not take away an access anybody currently has.

    #: ── THE FORM HAS BEEN POSTING THESE TWO ALL ALONG ────────────────────────
    #:
    #: `TeamsPage.addMember` sends `receives_approval_emails` and `company_name`
    #: on every add where the role is `client` — it has a toggle and a text box
    #: for them, sitting directly above the button. Pydantic's default is to
    #: IGNORE an unknown key, so both were parsed off the body and thrown away.
    #: The POST answered 200, the card appeared, and nothing anywhere had
    #: changed. That is the worst shape a defect takes in this product: the save
    #: succeeds and the value goes nowhere, so nobody reports it as broken —
    #: they just re-enter it, and it disappears again.
    #:
    #: Both columns exist, and have all along. Live catalogue 2026-08-27:
    #: `public.team_members.receives_approval_emails boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT
    #: true` and `public.team_members.company_name text NULL`; `public.users`
    #: carries the same pair with the same types; `public.project_assignments`
    #: does too (migration 195 copies them across). The measure of how long this
    #: has been dropped is that **0 of 212 `team_members` rows carry a
    #: `company_name`, and 0 of 212 have `receives_approval_emails` FALSE** —
    #: the toggle has never once been written by anybody, in any org.
    #:

    #: form omits both entirely for a non-client role, and a non-None default
    #: would make "the caller said nothing" indistinguishable from "the caller
    #: said the default" — which is exactly how the write below would come to
    #: blank a company name that somebody else had set. `None` means UNSAID, and

    #:
    #: It was `email:str` — required — so the two handlers that answer with this
    #: model had no way to withhold an address short of a model change, and both
    #: of them build the row from `RETURNING *` on `team_members`, whose `email`
    #: column is NOT NULL in practice (212 of 212 live rows carry one). The
    #: response therefore disclosed an address unconditionally, to whoever had
    #: got past the gate.
    #:
    #: Now it carries an address ONLY when the caller supplied that address in
    #: the same request. See the block over `add_team_member`.
    email:Optional[str]=None

    #: WHAT REPLACED IT. `TeamMemberOut` returned no name at all, so TeamsPage —
    #: which splices this row straight into the roster it has already drawn —
    #: fell through `m.display_name || m.full_name || m.email` to the address on
    #: every add and every role change. Withdrawing the email without supplying
    #: a name would have left that expression on `'?'`.
    #:
    #: Resolved with the same COALESCE `get_team` and `list_team_members` use,
    #: so the optimistically-spliced row is character-for-character the row the

    #: ── THE OTHER TWO THE ROSTER RENDERS ─────────────────────────────────────
    #:
    #: Same reason as `display_name`, one layer along. TeamsPage splices this
    #: response into the roster it has already drawn, and `NewTaskModal`'s
    #: assignee list reads `m.company_name` and `m.receives_approval_emails` off
    #: those same rows — the second one is what draws the "Client Approver"
    #: badge. `get_team` supplies both on a refresh; without them here the card
    #: the user just created is the only one on the page missing its company and
    #: its badge, until something else forces a refetch.
    #:
    #: NEITHER IS A CONTACT DETAIL, which is the question that has to be asked
    #: of anything added to this model. `company_name` is already in the
    #: platform branch of `GET /api/users` (it selects `u.company_name` for all
    #: 45 directory rows) and already in `get_team`'s roster, so it discloses
    #: nothing to Aekam that Aekam cannot already read; `receives_approval_
    #: emails` is a boolean preference that names nobody. The rule established
    #: over `add_team_member` — no ADDRESS is returned that the caller did not
    #: supply — is untouched: no email is involved in either field.

#
# `services/storage.upload_file` used to answer with a base64 `data:` URI

# and every screen reported success — 32 MB of screen recordings and signed
# PDFs reached `tasks.attachments` that way, in an 82 MB database. Removing that
# fallback closes the UPLOAD path. It does not close this one: the four JSON
# write paths below take an attachment list straight off a client request, so
# bytes can be posted into the column by hand while R2 is perfectly healthy.
#
# Matched by SHAPE, not by prefix: `data:`, then a media type carrying neither
# a comma nor a space, then the comma that begins the payload. A note that
# opens "data: 19 Aug, revised" is not a data URI and is not refused.

#: A stored URL may name http or https, or no scheme at all: `LOCAL_STORAGE_URL`

    from module scope, where it did not exist — it was nested inside
    row_to_task. Both of those raised NameError on every request.

    ── A BLANK STRING IS THE DEFAULT, NOT A CRASH ───────────────────────────

    `json.loads("")` raises `JSONDecodeError: Expecting value`, which reaches
    the caller as a 500 on a task list rather than as anything a person could
    act on. `_subtasks_of` below has always guarded this with `or "[]"`; this
    function did not, and the two disagreeing about the same column is worse
    than either rule on its own.

    Whether an empty string is REACHABLE is not settled — a valid jsonb value
    never renders as `''`, and NULL arrives as `None`. But the string branch
    exists precisely because a connection whose codec handshake PgBouncer
    killed hands back raw text (`_init_conn` warns and returns it anyway), and
    that is not a path anybody has characterised. The default costs one
    comparison and removes the difference between the two functions.

    ── AND WHY IT RETURNS A COPY ────────────────────────────────────────────

    `add_task_attachment` does `current = _pj(row["attachments"], [])` and then
    `current.append(...)`. When the driver hands back a decoded list, that
    appends INTO the row's own value — the caller mutates something it was only
    given to read.

    In production that is harmless: every fetch decodes afresh, so the mutated
    object dies with the request. It is not harmless in general, and it was
    invisible for as long as `tests/helpers.py` seeded these columns as STRINGS
    — the `json.loads` branch happens to produce a fresh object every time, so
    every read-modify-write path in the suite was quietly getting a copy that
    the real decoded path does not give. Fixing the fixture to match the driver
    is what surfaced it.

    `_subtasks_of` below already states this rule for its default ("a caller
    that then `.append`s to it wants that default to be a fresh list, not a
    shared one"). The same reasoning applies to the VALUE, so the copy is made
    here once rather than left to each caller to remember.

    Shallow, deliberately: it defends against `append`/`pop`/`update` on the
    container, which is what callers here actually do, and a deep copy of every
    jsonb column on every row of a task list would be a real cost for a hazard
    nobody has.

    """The `subtasks` list off a `tasks` row, however the driver handed it over.

    ── WHY A ROW FROM A `jsonb` COLUMN IS NOT ALWAYS A `str` ────────────────

    `db.py::_init_conn` registers a `jsonb` codec on every connection, so
    asyncpg DECODES the column and hands back a Python list. The four subtask
    routes below were written for the world before that codec and called
    `json.loads(task["subtasks"] or "[]")` on it, which is
    `json.loads(<list>)` — `TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or
    bytearray, not list`, on every add, toggle, rename and delete of a subtask.
    Sentry recorded 22 of them across three issues on 2026-08-24 before the
    first repair. `db.py`'s own docstring names this exact failure: "Several
    routers already carry defensive `json.loads` for exactly that, which is the
    symptom."

    So the cause is not a missing type check, it is four hand-written parses of
    a column the driver has already parsed. This function is where that
    knowledge lives once. `_pj` above is the same idea for `row_to_task`'s
    columns; this one exists separately only because it is the read half of a
    read-modify-write and must guarantee a list — `_pj`'s default is returned
    unparsed, and a caller that then `.append`s to it wants that default to be a
    fresh list, not a shared one.

    ── AND WHY THE `str` BRANCH IS STILL LOAD-BEARING ───────────────────────

    Two reasons, both measured, so removing it would be wrong:

      · ✅ **REPAIRED 2026-09-05 by migration 270** — but the branch stays, and
        the reason is the next bullet, not this one.

        It read: "54 of 485 live `tasks` rows hold `subtasks` as a jsonb STRING,
        not an array (2026-08-27, `jsonb_typeof`: 431 array, 54 string). Every
        one of the 54 is the text `'[]'` — double-encoded rows left over from
        before the encoder fix `db.py::_json_encoder` describes, dumped once by
        a caller and once more by the codec … only a data migration can repair
        them, and that is a WRITE against the shared production database, so it
        is recorded here rather than done."

        It was still exactly 54 when re-measured on 2026-09-05, all of them the
        empty `'"[]"'`. The column is now one shape: **434 rows, 434 array,
        0 string**. `jsonb_array_length(subtasks)` runs over the whole table
        without a `CASE` guard — 53 subtasks across 13 tasks, 5 on the busiest —
        which it could not do before.
      · `_init_conn` WARNS rather than raises when PgBouncer kills the codec
        handshake three times, and hands the connection out anyway. A connection
        with no codec returns every jsonb column as text.

    Neither branch is speculative, and each is reached by a different real
    condition.

# the first match won and these never served a request.
#
# Removed rather than left, because they were only ever one line from serving. The
# two implementations were not variants of each other:
#
#   · `auth_router`'s `/me` reads `staging.user_roles` and returns `platform_roles`
#     and `module_grants`. The nav is built from those — `navConfig.js:126` names
#     `auth_router.py::_module_grants` by hand. The version here returned a flat
#     profile with neither, so had the mount order ever been reordered the whole
#     RBAC-driven nav would have silently emptied, with no error anywhere.
#   · `auth_router`'s `/logout` honours `_COOKIE_SECURE` and `_COOKIE_DOMAIN`. This
#     one hardcoded `secure=True` and passed no domain, so it could not reliably
#     clear a cookie it had not set the same way.

# Two handlers on one path is not a duplicate to tidy later; it is a behaviour
# change waiting on an unrelated edit to `include_router` ordering.

    ── The bug this closes, which the owner saw on his own screen ─────────────

    The sidebar said 3 and the page listed nothing. Measured live, on real
    accounts:

        Kasti Pranami   badge=3    page lists=0
        Kasti ORG       badge=18   page lists=0
        QA Org Admin    badge=3    page lists=0

    Three separate causes, all of them "two readers, two rules":

    1. THE QUEUE'S FIRST ARM ADMITTED ONLY `project_assignments`. The
       task-level arm four lines below it, the history and the stats all
       admitted `project_assignments` OR `team_members`. Live there are 203
       `team_members` rows and 92 `project_assignments` rows, and **129 people
       are in the first and not the second** — every one of them was counted
       by the badge and shown an empty queue.

    2. THE BADGE COUNTED ONLY ONE OF THE TWO SOURCES. This surface has two:
       `approvals` (a request to CREATE a task) and `tasks.approval_status` (a
       request to CLOSE one). The queue returns both, concatenated. The badge
       counted `tasks` alone, so it could not have matched the page even for a
       caller who passed both membership tests.

    3. THE BADGE HAD NO ORG PREDICATE, under a comment that said "Scoped:".
       `is_org_admin(uid, org)` chose which branch ran; neither branch filtered
       by org. An owner who is admin in three organisations had all three
       companies' backlogs summed into whichever one he was looking at.

    So the rule lives here, once, and the badge, the queue, the history and the
    stats all call it. Two readers of one number must not be able to disagree
    about who may see it — that is the whole content of this bug.

    ── Why `role IN ('owner','admin')` ───────────────────────────────────────

    An approval is an act of authority, not of membership. A plain member of a
    project is not entitled to approve its work, and the badge's old admin
    branch admitted `pa.user_id=$1` with no role at all — which is the widest
    of the four rules and the reason its number was the largest.

    ── ONE TABLE, SINCE 2026-08-22 ───────────────────────────────────────────

    Cause (1) above — "203 team_members rows, 92 project_assignments rows, 129
    people in the first and not the second" — is the exact divergence migration
    195 closed. Measured live after it: 49 active `team_members` rows carry
    owner/admin, and every one of them has a `project_assignments` row at the
    SAME role (the owner/admin-only-in-team_members population is 0). So the
    second EXISTS that used to sit here could not admit anybody the first does
    not already admit, and it is gone. It read `tm.user_id=${idx}` against a
    `text` column while the first reads a `character varying` one, which is the
    ambiguity `auth_router`'s sync comment warns about; with one table left, the
    parameter has exactly one target type and needs no cast.

    # `task_title` ADDED 2026-08-08, and the bug it fixes was visible on screen:
    # the tablet's Today column listed three approvals reading "Untitled task".
    #
    # This arm was `SELECT a.*`, and `approvals` HAS a `task_id` column but no
    # title. The mobile client classifies a row with a string `task_id` as a
    # task approval (`api/approvals.isTaskApproval`) and then looks for
    # `task_title`, which was never sent — so it fell back to its honest label
    # and printed it three times. The client was right; the response was
    # incomplete, which is the same shape as the audit log that could not name
    # anyone, and no frontend change could have fixed either.
    #
    # COALESCE, not a plain join: this table carries BOTH kinds of row. One
    # names an existing task (join `tasks` for its title) and one is a REQUEST
    # to create a task that does not exist yet, whose intended title lives in
    # `request_data->>'title'`. Either can be null on a malformed row, so the
    # client keeps its fallback — a response is not a guarantee.

    ── THE HOLE THIS CLOSES, MEASURED ON STAGING 2026-08-29 ───────────────────

    `list_comments` and `add_comment` asked exactly one access question —
    "`is_portal_client`? then `client_can_access_task`" — and had NO ELSE. Every
    caller who is not a portal client, which is every ordinary staff account in
    every organisation, fell straight through to `WHERE c.task_id=$1` with no
    team predicate, no org predicate and no membership predicate of any kind.

    Reproduced from a browser session, not from the source:

        caller  user_21457956f010 (kevalvshah03+1@gmail.com)

    All three tasks belong to **Aekam Inc**. Live exposure at that moment:
    **87 comments over 29 tasks, 22 of them on 15 Aekam Inc tasks**, readable
    by any of the ~50 authenticated accounts in the database. ACTIVE, not
    latent — the read above is the walk-through.

    ── WHY THIS SHAPE, AND WHY IT WAS MISSED ─────────────────────────────────

    It is the sibling of the four approval writes fixed the same week: a guard
    added FOR THE CLIENT, with the staff path left as the fall-through. The
    comment thread's own siblings were already swept — `edit_comment` and
    `delete_comment` both carry `is_org_admin(uid, org)` AND
    `_comment_task_in_org`, and `routers/time_entries.py::_assert_task_access`
    guards the Time tab of the same drawer. The two handlers that FEED the
    drawer were the two nobody came back to.

    ── THE PREDICATE IS `get_task`'s, DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED ─────────────────

    Transcribed rung for rung from `get_task` (`GET /api/tasks/{task_id}`)
    rather than invented, because the contract has to be "if you can open the
    task, you can read its thread". Anything narrower re-opens the 2026-08-08
    defect this endpoint already has a regression file for
    (`tests/test_task_drawer_access.py`): an org administrator who is not on
    the project could LIST a task and be refused its detail, and the drawer
    opened onto an empty skeleton. Anything wider is the hole above.

    So the rungs are: the caller owns or raised it · they are assigned to it ·
    they administer the task's OWN organisation (both halves, never one) ·
    the task's project is inside `get_visible_team_ids` for the ACTIVE org ·
    a `task_clients` row names them. `is_portal_client` callers do not come
    here at all — `client_can_access_task` is their gate and it is stricter.

    Raises 404 for a task that does not exist and 403 for one that does, which
    is `get_task`'s existing distinction and not a new disclosure: the caller
    already learns both from `GET /api/tasks/{id}`.

    This used to return every registered user on the platform: display name,
    email, role and company, for every tenant, gated on `users.role == 'admin'`
    — a global column with no org scope on it at all. Two things were wrong.
    Whoever held that flag saw every customer's staff directory, and an actual
    org owner did not (their `users.role` is 'member'), so the picker was
    simultaneously too open and broken for the people meant to use it.

    Now: platform staff see everyone, because supporting a customer means being
    able to find their users. An org owner or admin sees their own org. Nobody
    else gets a directory.

    ── AEKAM DOES NOT SEE CUSTOMER EMAIL ADDRESSES ─────────────────────────────

    Changed 2026-08-07 on the owner's instruction: "Aekam must not be able to see
    client personal data, and orgs must not see each other's."

    The platform branch above returned `email` for EVERY user of EVERY tenant, to
    all eight platform roles, and left no audit row — so a support account could
    read the whole customer base's address book and nothing recorded that it had.
    Two changes:

      · The branch selects a NAME and the organisations that name belongs to. It
        does not select `email`, and `display_name` no longer COALESCEs down to
        one — which was the same leak wearing a different column name. A user
        with no name on file is listed as such, which is enough to find them and
        then ask.
      · Reading the platform-wide directory now writes `platform.user_directory_
        read`. Reading a customer's data is the event this product's audit log
        exists to record, and the org branch below needs no row for the same
        reason: it is an org's own admin reading their own members.

    Contact details are not gone, they are gated: the approved support-session
    flow (`routers/support_sessions.py`) is where an Aekam account asks for
    access to one organisation, gets it granted, and leaves a row saying so.
    Billing surfaces get seat COUNTS, never a roster.

    ── THE RESPONSE ECHOES AN ADDRESS, IT NEVER DISCLOSES ONE ─────────────────

    The owner's standing rule is that Aekam must not see a customer's member
    addresses, and `GET /api/users` was fixed for it: its platform branch
    selects a name and no email, pinned by the four tests at the top of
    `tests/test_platform_privacy.py`. THIS ROUTE WAS THE WAY ROUND THAT FIX, and
    the commit that opened it says so in its own subject line.

    `79079e14 fix: team add button dead for platform staff` — the button was
    dead BECAUSE of the privacy fix. TeamsPage sends `selectedUser.email`, the
    platform directory had stopped supplying one, so the POST arrived with no
    address and 422'd. The repair was to let the caller send a `user_id`
    instead and have the server resolve the address. It then returned that
    address in `TeamMemberOut.email`.

    Which is a user_id-to-email oracle, gated by `is_platform_staff` — see the
    bypass below — and measured against the live database on 2026-08-27 it
    covers all 50 user rows, every one of which has an address. The directory
    fix removed 50 addresses from one response and this route handed them back
    one call at a time.

    So the rule here is the one `routers/org_invites.py::issue_invite` already
    states: NO ADDRESS IS RETURNED TO THE CALLER THAT THE CALLER DID NOT
    SUPPLY. Deliberately NOT keyed on `god`. A role check answers "who is
    asking", which is a question whose answer has been re-scoped twice in this
    codebase — `is_platform_staff` is still unscoped today while `may_act_in_org`
    next to it is not — and a response that re-opens when somebody adjusts a
    role tuple is not closed. "Did this request carry the address?" cannot drift
    and cannot be widened by a change anywhere else.

    In practice it costs the org side nothing: an org admin's directory still
    carries emails, so TeamsPage sends `email` for them and gets it back. It is
    the platform caller — whose directory has no addresses to send — that falls
    through to the `user_id` branch, and that branch now answers with a name.

    ── WHAT IS *NOT* CLOSED HERE, AND IS THE OWNER'S CALL ─────────────────────

    The `is_platform_staff` bypass itself. It is unscoped — one row in
    `staging.user_roles` with `org_id IS NULL` — so all 10 live platform
    accounts may write a membership row into any of the 45 projects across all
    5 organisations, including the one organisation no platform account belongs
    to. That contradicts `may_act_in_org` ("God mode can only switch between
    orgs if they are part of it") and it is a WRITE to a customer's access
    control, not the "seeing the project structure" that `is_platform_staff`'s
    own docstring says its call sites are for.

    NARROWED 2026-08-27 on the owner's decision — "platform account having role
    account manager can probably do". This route now uses
    `may_manage_project_membership`, which reads GOD_MODE_ROLES + MANAGER_ROLES
    only, so the write went from ten platform accounts to six and the four
    `platform_staff` accounts lost it. It does NOT re-break the 403 that
    `af74d321` fixed: that fix was real and platform staff genuinely could not
    use TeamsPage: the bypass is kept for the tier with a business reason to
    manage a customer's account and removed from the tier without one.

    # ── BOTH HALVES OF THIS PATCH NOW REACH `project_assignments` ────────────
    #
    # FIX #5 (2026-05-14) made the ROLE sync conditional, because a status-only
    # PATCH was writing NULL into `project_assignments.role`. That guard is
    # right and stays. What it left behind was the other half: the STATUS was
    # never synced at all, because `project_assignments` has no `status` column
    # — membership there is the existence of the row.
    #
    # That was survivable only while the reads UNIONed both tables and asked
    # `team_members.status='active'`. Phase 2 stopped asking: `is_project_member`
    # and `get_visible_team_ids` now read `project_assignments` alone, so
    # deactivating somebody in the roster while leaving their assignment row
    # standing would have REVOKED NOTHING — they would keep the project, the
    # tasks and the board, and the screen would say they were removed. A
    # deactivation that does not deactivate is the worst possible outcome of a
    # read cutover, and it is the one this closes.
    #
    # So: any status that is not 'active' deletes the assignment row, and 'active'
    # puts it back. Re-activation needs the role, and `payload.role` may be
    # absent on a status-only PATCH — `row` is the UPDATE's RETURNING, so it
    # carries the role as it now stands whether or not this call changed it.
    #
    # `team_members.role` is unconstrained text; `project_assignments.role` has
    # a CHECK for ('owner','admin','member','client'). A roster role outside that
    # set would make this INSERT raise and turn a member edit into a 500, so it
    # is mapped to 'member' — the least privilege the CHECK admits — rather than
    # rejected. Live 2026-08-22 every role in both tables is inside the set, so
    # this maps nothing today; it exists so a future stray value degrades to
    # "still a member" instead of an error.

    # migration 009 added and the live catalogue confirms. `$3::varchar` is

    last session rather than refetching whole lists. With `since` this returns

    envelope (`services/delta_sync`), and:

      * the ARCHIVED filter is not applied. Without `since`, archived tasks are

        since the last sync is a CHANGE the device has to hear about, and
        filtering it out is how the phone keeps showing a task the web archived.
        The client removes any row it receives carrying `archived_at`.
      * deletions do not appear here at all — tasks are hard-deleted, so they
        arrive through `GET /v1/sync/tombstones` (migration 138).

    ── WHY A TASK NEEDS ITS OWN PREDICATE ─────────────────────────────────────

    `get_visible_team_ids(…, org_id=org)` answers "which teams may this caller
    see in this org", and every route that asks it is scoped. The routes that
    are NOT scoped are the ones that never ask, because they short-circuit on
    `is_org_admin` first — and narrowing WHO reaches that hatch (the previous
    pass) is not the same as narrowing WHAT it hands back. `get_task` still
    returned any task in the database to an admin of the active org, and
    `delete_task` still DELETED one. This is the missing half.

    ── HOW A TASK'S ORG IS DERIVED ────────────────────────────────────────────

    ⚠ THIS PARAGRAPH SAID `tasks.org_id` DOES NOT EXIST. IT DOES, NOW.
    Measured from `information_schema` 2026-08-29: `public.tasks.org_id` is a
    real column holding 280 rows, **240 populated and 40 NULL**. Whatever
    applied it, `PROPOSED_076` is no longer the whole story and the negative
    was stale — the standing rule is that nothing is called missing without a
    live query, and this comment was a live query nobody had re-run.

    The derivation below is KEPT ANYWAY, and not out of caution: 40 rows carry
    no `org_id`, so the column cannot be the sole predicate without silently
    refusing every one of them. It is now a corroborating signal rather than
    the absent one, and the org is still reached through the task's team — the
    same route `get_visible_team_ids` takes.

      team_id set   -> `teams.org_id` must equal `org`, **or be NULL**. The NULL
                       leg is not a hole and is spelled out for the same reason
                       `get_visible_team_ids` spells it out: 2 of the 29 live
                       teams carry no `org_id`, a team in no organisation has no
                       tenant to leak from, and dropping it would 403 the people
                       whose only membership is one of those two.

      team_id NULL  -> a PERSONAL task. It has no team, so the only tenancy
                       signal left is its owner: the task is in `org` when its
                       `user_id` or `created_by_user_id` holds a `user_roles`
                       row there. An admin keeps reading their own members'
                       personal tasks; another tenant's are refused.

    ── `org is None` MEANS "NO OPINION", NOT "EVERYTHING" ─────────────────────

    True, deliberately. `active_org_id` returns None for the two populations its
    own docstring names — portal clients, who hold no org role at all, and staff
    whose only membership is an `org_id IS NULL` team. Refusing them here would
    turn the leak into a 403 on the main task surface, which is a different
    incident with the same root cause. They keep exactly the answer they had.

# MB — four screen recordings, two screenshots, five executed e-sign PDFs — and
# the database fell from 82 MB to 49 MB. `tasks.attachments` holds no data URI
# now, and the validators on `Attachment` and `custom_fields` are why it cannot
# acquire one.
#
# It is not kept as a standing tool. It called `upload_file` with no `org_id`,
# so for an org holding its own R2 credentials it re-uploaded the customer's
# file into the VENDOR's bucket and pointed the row there — the tenancy error
# is silent, and worse than the row it repaired. And it rewrote `attachments`
# on every matching task in the database with no org predicate anywhere on the
# path, which is a cross-tenant mass write kept armed for work that is done.
#
# If a data URI is ever found in a column again, the fault is upstream — a
# write path that skipped these models — and the repair belongs in a one-off
# script written against the rows actually found, not in a permanently mounted
# route that rewrites every task in the database.

    wrong for this table specifically: rows are inserted at the head while the
    user reads, so `OFFSET 40` after a new arrival re-serves a row the caller
    already rendered and skips one it never saw. A keyset cursor is anchored to
    a row, so an insert above it changes nothing about the page below it.

    The tiebreaker is not decoration. `_notify_status_changed` and the reminder
    dispatch both insert a row per recipient inside one loop, so a batch shares
    a `created_at` to the microsecond; ordering on that column alone leaves the
    order inside a batch undefined and a cursor sitting mid-batch can drop or

    ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT. `outbound_log.write()` buffers in memory and
    returns — that is why a payroll run that mails 71 payslips costs one
    statement and nothing on the request path — so whatever is still buffered
    when this hook runs exists ONLY in this process. `shutdown()` is the drain,
    and it needs the pool that `close_pool()` is about to take away; after that
    line there is nothing left to write with.

    It matters here more than it would elsewhere because Railway redeploys this
    service constantly, and the rows most likely to be in the buffer at that
    moment are the most interesting ones: `email_service` and
    `services/employee_email` report the provider's answer from a background
    thread that can outlive the request that started it, and that answer is the
    half of the row carrying the SES MessageId — the only join key a later
    bounce notification has.

    Bounded and non-raising by construction (see its docstring), so a logger
    cannot fail a deploy any more than it can fail a send.
