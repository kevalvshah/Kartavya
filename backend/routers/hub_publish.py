# THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES. `_fetch_meta_accounts` did `page = page_list[0]` and
# `_fetch_google_locations` did `accounts[0]` then `locations[0]`. A firm
# administering three Pages got whichever Facebook happened to return first, was
# never asked, and was never told. `_fetch_linkedin_profile` was worse: it stored
# `sub` from /v2/userinfo, so every post a firm made landed on the personal feed
# of whichever partner happened to click Connect.
#
# THE OWNER'S RULE, given 2026-08-21 when asked whether LinkedIn should post as a
# person or a Company Page: "any connectors can do both. depends on org — someone
# org is sole business owner who is its own page." And on the picker: "also
# option to have multiple for all connectors ... as a company can have multiple
# account across social media."
#
# So there is one question, asked of every network, with more than one allowed
# answer: **post as…?** A sole trader picks themselves. A firm picks its page. An
# agency picks several. Each chosen destination becomes its own row and is posted
# to independently.
#
# WHAT A DESTINATION IS, per network. The picker names the kind beside the name
# because "Aekam Inc" alone does not tell anybody whether they are about to post
# to a personal timeline or a company page.
